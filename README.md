# Integra-Magna-Technical-Assignment
## Approach
My strategy was to avoid Flexbox entirely inplace of it. i use "display: grid";
I used a vertical Grid (`grid-template-rows`) for the Header, Main Body, and Footer to ensure they stack correctly.
use Media quries for responsive design.
Add dark mode and light mode (Toggle Switch) funtinaliy for best user expriense.
## What I Struggled With
The most challenging part is main section and hero section it consume the more time.
I used mostly flex box in Css for Styling, so I faced some problems.

## Known Issues
It took a lot of time to make the hero and main-section and I faced some problems but I finally completed them.
Due to shortage of time I could not complete the assignment 100%. But I did my best
